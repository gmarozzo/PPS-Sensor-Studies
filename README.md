# PPS Sensor Studies

This is a collection of the scripts used for the studies of the LGAD sensors for the HL-LHC PPS.

Please note that most calculations and outputs are obtained from jupyter notebooks.
If you are contributing, please keep in mind that you must strip the output before committing the files.
We do this in order to keep the diffs easily readable.

In order to run the Voltage notebook, the hitmaps files from https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/68NCQGt12ekKiy7 are needed.
